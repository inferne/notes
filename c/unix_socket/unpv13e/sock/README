	This source files in this directory assume tab stops every 4 positions,
not every 8 (the default).  Just ":set tabstop=4" in vi, for example.

	If your system doesn't define the POSIX.1 ssize_t data type, then
delete the appropriate #ifdef/#endif lines at the beginning of "ourhdr.h".

	If your system's <stdlib.h> doesn't define the variables for getopt(),
then delete the appropriate #ifdef/#endif lines at the beginning of "ourhdr.h".

	If your system doesn't support send() and recv() (e.g., OSF/1) then
delete the appropriate #ifdef/#endif lines at the beginning of "ourhdr.h".
